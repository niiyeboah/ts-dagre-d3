- `edgeLabelX` and `edgeLabelY` options to change the position of edge labels.
- Node `x` and `y` properties to allow for overriding calculated layout and manually setting position.
- Edge `x`, `y` and `manualPosition` properties to allow for overriding calculated layout and manually setting position and control points.
- Compatible with ES modules and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) out of the box.
